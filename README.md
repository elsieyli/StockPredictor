# StockPredictor
Using LSTM
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Stock price data is sourced using yfinance, followed by scaling with MinMaxScaler to normalize the data for optimal performance with LSTM, which is sensitive to input scales.

Data Preparation: Time series data is transformed into sequential datasets, where each sequence of n_steps is used to predict the subsequent value, ensuring the model learns temporal patterns effectively.

Model Construction: A robust LSTM model is built with strategically placed dropout layers to mitigate overfitting, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Training and Evaluation: After training on the preprocessed sequences, the model forecasts stock prices on the test set, with predictions visualized alongside actual prices, offering a clear assessment of the model's predictive accuracy.
